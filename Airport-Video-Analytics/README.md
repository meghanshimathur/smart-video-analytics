# 🛫 Airport Video Analytics System (YOLO + OpenCV)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements an intelligent Airport Video Analytics system using YOLO and OpenCV.  
It analyzes CCTV footage to detect people, estimate crowd density, generate motion heatmaps, identify overcrowded areas, and detect abandoned objects.

The system demonstrates how modern computer vision can improve airport safety and passenger management.
