# 🚦 Traffic Monitoring System (YOLO + OpenCV)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a real-time Traffic Monitoring System using YOLO and OpenCV.  
It detects vehicles from video streams and performs analytics such as speed estimation, congestion analysis, and two-wheeler/four-wheeler counting.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Vehicle detection using YOLO
- Speed estimation (pixel displacement method)
- Two-wheeler and four-wheeler classification
- Traffic congestion detection (Low / Medium / High)
- Real-time visualization using OpenCV

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
